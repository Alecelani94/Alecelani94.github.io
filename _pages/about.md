I am a postdoctoral researcher in Economics and Statistics at [Örebro University](https://www.oru.se/) specializing in econometrics and empirical macroeconomics. 

I obtained my PhD at Università Politecnica delle Marche under the joint supervision of Maria Cristina Recchioni and Paolo Giudici. During my doctoral studies, I was a visiting researcher at the School of Statistics at the University of Minnesota and held a research internship in the Research Department of the Dutch Central Bank.

My research interests include time series and multi dimensional econometrics, bayesian methods, and empirical macroeconomics.
